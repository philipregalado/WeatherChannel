### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned in this lesson how to further use API kyes, and know as to what id's they use to call on. 
2. I worked on using javascript to display information found by my API key on my HTML screen in a row/table fashion.
3. This was the first time that my search engine was able to use more than one type of input, either zipcode, address, city, etc. This was a cool thing to work on and be able to see how far you can search in a database with an API key.
